This is an example of a folder structure using helm

# Chart Directory Structure

Helm charts are organized in a standard directory structure. At a minimum, a chart directory includes:
- templates directory: Contains all the template files (e.g., Service and Deployment manifests).
- values.yaml file: Provides the default configuration values.
- Chart.yaml file: Holds metadata about the chart.

Additional files such as a LICENSE or README, and directories like charts (for dependent charts) might also be included.
